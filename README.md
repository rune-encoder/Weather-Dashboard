# Weather Dashboard

## Description

If you need to check on the weather, try this weather app. 
It is super easy to use. You just have to type in the city you wish to check the weather for.

You will get up to date weather information. It will display the current temperature, description, wind speed and humidity.
You will also be able to see the the next 5 day forcast for the chosen city.  

To make things convenient if you leave the page and return to it in the future, your search history will be displayed.
You just have to press on this button to show the updated weather for the city saved in your history.

A little backstory: Creating this app was exiting and scary. There were so many challenges along the way. Some things would break here and there and it would take me a while to find a proper solution. I really tried to challend myself on the syle aswell. It was also interesting trying to figure out how not to have the recent search history and local storage affected by duplicate searches (to prevent duplicate buttons on the search history and duplicate data on local storage). Hope you like it!

Awesome Points:  
**1. Application is mobile friendly. It will adapt to Desktop mode and Mobile mode.**  
**2. Application saves history. History is easily accessed and cleared.**
